## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis, findings, and insights from a real-world business scenario involving Bellabeat. The project is designed to answer how consumers use smart devices similar to Bellabeat’s products and to recommend data-driven strategies for company growth and improved customer engagement.

## About Bellabeat

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Founded in 2013, the company collects and analyzes data related to activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to promote well-being. Bellabeat’s core mission is to empower women by providing actionable insights into their personal health and everyday habits.

## Business Task

Bellabeat’s executive leadership wants to:

- Analyze smart device usage data (from FitBit) to gain deeper user behavior insights.
- Identify trends that could be applied to Bellabeat customers and products.
- Make informed recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing and product strategy.


## Dataset Description

- **Source:** FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (public dataset via Kaggle)
- **Data Period:** March 12, 2016 – May 12, 2016
- **Sample Size:** Data from 30 FitBit users—including minute-level physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.
- **Data Types:** Activity, sleep, heart rate, calories, steps, etc.

> **Note:** The dataset was not originally collected or provided by Bellabeat but is widely used for analytics capstone projects due to its depth and relevance to health-tracking product analysis.

## Analysis Process

This case study generally follows these six steps:

1. **Ask:** Clearly define the business objectives and main questions.
2. **Prepare:** Collect, review, and assess the FitBit dataset for credibility and completeness.
3. **Process:** Clean and transform the data for analysis (remove duplicates, fix/convert data types, aggregate as needed for trends).
4. **Analyze:** Explore trends, correlations, and patterns in device usage (activity vs. calories, sleep vs. sedentary behavior, weekday vs. weekend activity, etc.).
5. **Share:** Visualize and communicate findings (see attached notebooks and PDFs for specific chart outputs).
6. **Act:** Develop actionable recommendations for Bellabeat based on data-driven insights.
